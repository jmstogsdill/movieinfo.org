            <h3>Acclaimed director Ridley Scott warns AI will be ‘technical hydrogen bomb’ in film industry</h3>
            <p class="date">Published on: Dec 1, 2023</p>
            <p>Ridley Scott, the director of sci-fi classics like "Alien" and "Blade Runner," expressed concern about the potential for AI technology to run away with society. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Scott stated that he believes that AI is a threat that cannot be controlled and that it could potentially take over the world's electrical-monetary system. He compared his concerns to the film "Blade Runner," where he believed the world would end up being run by two corporations. Scott also expressed concern about AI's potential impact on Hollywood strikes, where the use of AI was a key sticking point in negotiations. He also noted that AI may not be creative enough to work with anything particularly special that requires emotion or soul. Julia Louis-Dreyfus, who recently demonstrated AI's creative limitations, also expressed her concerns.</p>
